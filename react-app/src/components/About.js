        </div>
        <p>&ensp; &ensp; My name is Alyssa! Im currently a fourth-year Computer Engineering student at Purdue University, where  I 
           am involved with organizations such as Purdue Space Day and GEARE. I am also a pathways intern at NASA's Glenn Research 
           Center! Here I assist as a member of the software development team working on NASA's High Rate Delay Tolerant Networking 
           project.
